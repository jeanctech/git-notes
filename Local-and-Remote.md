# Local and Remote

In the context of Git and GitHub, "local" and "remote" refer to two different environments in which source code repositories are managed. Here is the difference between both:

**Local Repository:**

A local repository is the copy of the Git repository that resides on your own machine. It is the working directory where you work with files, make changes, commit those changes, and generally develop your project. Local repositories can exist on your personal computer or on a local server. When you work in a local repository, all changes are made on your machine, and you can commit independently without needing Internet access.

**Remote Repository:**

A remote repository is a copy of the Git repository that resides on an online server or in a remote location accessible over the Internet. Examples of platforms that host remote repositories include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and custom remote Git servers. Remote repositories serve as a centralized location where developers collaborate and share their changes. You can "push" your local changes to a remote repository to share them with others, and "pull" changes from the remote repository to your local repository to keep it up to date with contributions from other contributors.

The relationship between a local and a remote repository in Git is established by linking the local repository to one or more remote repositories. This allows developers to collaborate, share changes, and maintain a single source of truth for code. When you work on a project, you typically make changes to your local repository and then sync those changes to a remote repository so others can view and collaborate on your work.

In short, the local repository is where you work on your code and make commits, while the remote repository is where those changes are stored and shared with other developers. The relationship between the two allows effective collaboration in software development projects.
