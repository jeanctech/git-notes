# Git Diff

`git diff` is a command in Git that is used to see the differences between two points in the history of the repository, whether between commits, between the working directory and the staging area, or between two different branches. `git diff` is a useful tool for understanding changes made to code and for identifying differences in files. Here are some common ways to use `git diff`:

1. **Differences between the working directory and the staging area:**

    To see the differences between the files in the working directory and the files in the staging area, you can run:

    ```shell
    git diff
    ```

    This will show differences in files that have not yet been added to the staging area.

2. **Differences between the staging area and the last commit:**

    To see the differences between the files in the staging area and the last commit, you can run:

    ```shell
    git diff --staged
    ```

    This will show the differences between the files that are in the staging area and the last commit.

3. **Differences between two commits:**

    To see the differences between two specific commits, you can provide their identifiers (hashes) or branch names:

    ```shell
    git diff commit1 commit2
    ```

    For example, to see the differences between commit `abc123` and commit `def456`, you can run:

    ```shell
    git diff abc123 def456
    ```

4. **Differences between one branch and another:**

    To see the differences between two branches, you can use:

    ```shell
    git diff branch1..branch2
    ```

    For example, to see the differences between the `feature` branch and the `main` branch, you can run:

    ```shell
    git diff feature..main
    ```

5. **Differences in a specific file:**

    If you want to see the diffs in a specific file, you can provide the file name after the `git diff` command:

    ```shell
    git diff file-name
    ```

    This will show the differences in the specified file between the working directory and the staging area.

Remember that `git diff` is a tool for viewing diffs and does not make changes to the repository. You can use `git diff` to review changes before committing them or to check for differences at different points in the project's history.
