# Personal Repository - Github

A "personal repository" refers to a Git repository that belongs to an individual developer or a specific user account on a repository hosting platform, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These personal repositories are spaces where a developer can store and manage their own source code, personal projects or resources related to their work or interests, without having to share them with other collaborators by default.

Some key features of personal repositories include:

1. **Personal code storage:** Personal repositories are ideal for storing individual software development projects, scripts, configurations, or any other resources related to the developer's work or personal interests.

2. **Privacy:** Personal repositories are typically private by default, meaning that the code and resources stored in them are not available to other users unless the repository owner chooses to explicitly share them.

3. **Access Control:** The repository owner has full control over who can access and collaborate on the repository. He can grant permissions to other users to view, clone, collaborate or manage the repository according to his needs.

4. **Collaboration optional:** Although personal repositories are primarily designed for individual projects, the owner can invite other collaborators to contribute to the project if desired. This allows collaboration on personal projects with other developers.

5. **Change Tracking:** As with any Git repository, changes made to a personal repository are logged and can be tracked over time using the commit history.

6. **Additional tools and services:** Personal repository hosting platforms often offer additional tools and services, such as issue tracking, continuous integration, and deployment options, which can be useful for personal projects.

Examples of personal repository hosting platforms include:

- **GitHub:** GitHub users can create private repositories as part of their paid subscription or use free repositories with public access. GitHub offers hosting of both public and private repositories.

- **GitLab:** GitLab allows users to create private repositories in the free edition of GitLab, or use the paid options for more functionality.

- **Bitbucket:** Bitbucket allows users to create free private repositories with a limited number of collaborators, or purchase a subscription for more resources and collaborators.

Personal repositories are a great way to maintain personal control and organization over your source code and projects, and allow you to work on personal projects, experiment with new technologies, and develop programming skills in a private environment. They are also useful for keeping a backup of your work and accessing it from different devices.
