# Branches - Git

In Git, branches are a fundamental feature that allows you to work on different development lines independently and simultaneously within a repository. Each branch represents a separate development line, and you can create, change and merge branches according to your needs. Here's a more detailed description of how branches work in Git:

1. **Main Branch (Branch):**
    In most Git repositories, there is a default main branch called "master" (or "main", depending on the convention used). This main branch usually represents the stable and working version of the project. It is considered the baseline from which other branches are created to develop new features or solve problems.

2. **Creation of Branches:**
    You can create a new branch in Git at any time. Typically, you create a new branch to work on a specific feature or to fix an issue. Use the `git checkout -b branch-name` command to create and switch to a new branch at the same time.

    ```shell
    git checkout -b new-branch
    ```

3. **Change between Branches:**
    You can switch between branches using the `git checkout` command. For example, to switch to the main branch, you can do:

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    ```

4. **List Branches:**
    To list all branches in your repository, use `git branch`. The current branch will be marked with an asterisk (*).

    ```shell
    git branch
    ```

5. **Merge Branches:**
    When you have finished working on a branch and want to push your changes to the main branch or another branch, you can use the `git merge` command. For example, to merge a branch to the main branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    git merge branch-name
    ```

6. **Delete Branches:**
    Once you're done with a branch and no longer need it, you can delete it with `git branch -d branch-name`.

    ```shell
    git branch -d branch-to-delete
    ```

7. **Conflict Resolution:**
    If two branches modify the same file in different places, conflicts can arise when merging them. Git will ask you to resolve these conflicts manually before the merge completes.

8. **Common Workflows:**
    In larger, more complex projects, specific workflows, such as GitFlow or the Semantic Branching Model, can be used to organize and manage branches more effectively.

Branches are an essential part of the workflow in Git and allow you to work efficiently, maintain a clean history, and collaborate with other developers on projects. It's important to understand how to create, change, merge, and delete branches to work effectively in Git.
