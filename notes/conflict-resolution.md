# Conflict Resolution - Git

Conflict resolution in Git occurs when two or more different branches or changes modify the same part of a file in the repository. Git cannot automatically determine which version is correct, so it requires users to manually resolve these conflicts before merging branches. Here I explain how to resolve conflicts in Git:

1. **Detect Conflicts:**
    Git will inform you if there are conflicts when you try to merge a branch or perform certain operations. For example, after running `git merge` or `git pull`, you will see a message indicating that conflicts have occurred.

2. **Open a Code Editor:**
    To resolve conflicts, open a code editor on your system, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or whatever you prefer. You can also use simple text editors if you want.

3. **Find the Conflicts:**
    In files that Git flags as conflicting, you'll see sections that look like this:

    ```shell
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Code in current branch
    =======
    Code in the branch you are trying to merge
    >>>>>>> branch-name
    ```

    The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents changes to the current branch (where you are) and the section between `=======` and ` >>>>>> branch-name` represents the changes to the branch you are trying to merge. You must decide which of these sections you want to keep and which you want to discard.

4. **Edit the File:**
    Edit the file to resolve the conflict. You can keep one version, combine both, or make additional changes as needed. Be sure to remove conflict flags (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and leave the file in a consistent state.

5. **Save Changes:**
    Once you've resolved conflicts in the file, save it.

6. **Confirm Changes:**
    Then use `git add` to mark the file as resolved and ready to commit.

    ```shell
    git add file-with-conflicts
    ```

7. **Continue with the Merger or Confirmation:**
    Once you've resolved all conflicts and committed the files with `git add`, you can continue with the merge or commit as you normally would.

8. **Complete the Merger or Confirmation:**
    After resolving conflicts, merge with `git merge` or commit with `git commit`.

9. **Delete the Merge Branch (Optional):**
    If you have completed a merge, you can delete the branch that was merged using `git branch -d branch-name`.

10. **Complete the Merger or Confirmation:**
     The merge or commit should now complete without conflicts.

Conflict resolution is a normal part of teamwork and is essential to maintaining code integrity. Make sure you communicate with other collaborators and resolve conflicts appropriately to ensure a smooth workflow and a bug-free code base.
