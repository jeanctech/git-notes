# Git Merge

`git merge` is a command in Git used to merge one branch with another. Merging involves combining changes from one branch into another branch, creating a new commit that reflects the combined changes. This process is used to combine features developed in different branches or to incorporate changes from a child branch into a main branch, such as `main` or `master`. Here is the basic syntax of the `git merge` command:

```shell
git merge branch-to-merge
```

Where `branch-to-merge` is the name of the branch you want to merge into the current branch.

The merging process involves the following steps:

1. **Switch to target branch:** Before merging, make sure you are on the branch you want to push changes to. For example, to merge the `my-function` branch into the `main` branch, first switch to the `main` branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    ```

2. **Run `git merge`:** Once on the target branch, run the `git merge` command with the name of the branch you want to merge. For example:

    ```shell
    git merge my-function
    ```

3. **Conflict resolution (if necessary):** If there are conflicts between changes in the target branch and the branch you are merging, Git will tell you that conflicts have occurred. You will need to open the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts manually, and then commit to finish the merge.

4. **Commit the merge:** Once the conflicts have been resolved and you are happy with the changes, commit the merge with a commit. Git will automatically generate a commit message that includes information about the merge.

The merge can generate a new commit that incorporates the changes from the merged branch into the target branch. This creates a commit history that shows when the merges were made and what changes were incorporated in each merge.

It's important to remember that merging is a common process in Git, especially in collaborative projects. It allows you to integrate new features and developments into a main branch or other branches in a controlled and efficient manner.
