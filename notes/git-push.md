# Git Push

`git push` is a command in Git that is used to push local changes in your Git repository to a remote repository. This means that it takes the commits made on your local branch and pushes them to the online repository (such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another remote Git server) so that other collaborators can access those changes. Here is the basic syntax of the `git push` command:

```shell
git push <remote-repository> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
```

- `<remote-repository>` is the name of the remote repository you want to push changes to. This is usually `origin` if you cloned a repository or whatever name you gave the remote repository.
- `<local-branch>` is the name of the local branch you want to push to the remote repository.
- `<remote-branch>` is the name of the branch in the remote repository where you want to push changes.

For example, to push changes from your local `main` branch to the remote repository called `origin`, you would use:

```shell
git push origin main
```

The `git push` command pushes local changes from the `main` branch to the `main` branch in the remote repository. If the branch does not exist in the remote repository, Git will create it. You can use `git push` to push your changes to different remote branches as needed.

It is important to note that to use `git push`, you must have write permissions to the remote repository. If you're working on a collaborative project, you may need to submit a pull request or request write permissions before you can `git push` directly to the remote repository.

In short, `git push` is a fundamental command to share your changes with other collaborators and keep your local repository in sync with the remote repository.
