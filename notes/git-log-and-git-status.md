# Git Log and Git Status

In Git, staging and working directory are two key concepts that allow you to manage changes to your files before committing them. Understanding how these concepts work is essential to working effectively with Git. Here I explain each of them:

**1. Git Status (Working Directory):**
The Git state, also known as the "working directory," is the directory on your computer where you work with your files. This is the place where you make changes, edit code, add new files, and delete existing files. The Git state contains all the files in your project, but not all of them are tracked by Git.

When you make changes to files in the Git state, Git considers them "modified." This means that the files have been edited in some way, but have not yet been checked in for confirmation. The modified files can be:

- **Modified:** Files that have been edited since the last commit.
- **New:** Files that you have created but have not yet been committed.
- **Deleted:** Files that you have deleted but have not yet been confirmed as deleted.

**2. Git Log (Staging):**
The Git log, also known as the "staging area", is an intermediate stage between the Git state and the commit. Allows you to select and prepare the specific changes you want to commit. It's like a checklist of changes to include in the next commit.

To "check in" a change, you must use the `git add` command. This adds changes to a specific file or list of files to the staging area. You can add all changes at once using `git add .` to add all changed and new files to the staging area.

Once you have finished staging your changes in the staging area, you can commit them using the `git commit` command. This logs changes to the repository history with a descriptive message.

The typical work cycle in Git involves editing files in the Git state, adding the relevant changes to the staging area, and finally committing the changes to the repository.

**Summary:**
- The "Git state" (working directory) is where you work with your files and where you make changes.
- "Git check-in" (staging) is an intermediate stage that allows you to select and prepare changes before committing them.
- You can use `git add` to add changes to the staging area and `git commit` to commit them to the repository.
- Understanding and properly using Git logging and status is essential to managing your project's version history and collaborating effectively with other developers.
