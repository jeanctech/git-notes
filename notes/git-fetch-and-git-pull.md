# Git Fetch and Git Pull

`git fetch` and `git pull` are two commands in Git used to fetch updates from a remote repository. Both commands perform similar functions, but have important differences in how they affect your local working directory and the relationship with the remote repository. Here is an explanation of each:

**`git fetch`**:

- `git fetch` downloads updates from the remote repository to your local repository, but does not make changes to your working directory. This means that downloaded changes will not be immediately reflected in your local files.
- `git fetch` updates remote references (such as remote branches) and downloads information about new commits, but does not modify your local branches.
- After running `git fetch`, you can use `git log origin/main` or `git log origin/remote-branch` to see updates that have arrived in the remote repository, but have not yet been checked into your local copy.
- To apply downloaded updates to your local branch, you must manually merge them or perform a `git pull`.

**`git pull`**:

- `git pull` combines two steps into one: perform a `git fetch` to download the updates from the remote repository and then perform a `git merge` or `git rebase` to merge the updates into your local branch. Therefore, `git pull` updates your local working directory with the changes from the remote repository.
- `git pull` is more convenient if you want to get the latest updates and merge them to your local branch in one step. However, keep in mind that this can cause merge conflicts if there are changes in both branches.
- Using `git pull` is more like a quick, automatic update, while `git fetch` gives you more control over when and how you want to pull in updates.

`git fetch` example:

```shell
git fetch origin
```

`git pull` example:

```shell
git pull origin main
```

In short, `git fetch` is useful when you want to get updates from the remote repository without modifying your working directory immediately. `git pull` is useful when you want to pull updates and merge them to your local branch in a single step. Choosing between the two commands depends on your specific preferences and needs.
