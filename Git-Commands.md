# Git Commands

Git is a powerful tool for version control and source code management. Here are some basic Git commands to help you get started.

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in a directory.

2. `git clone <URL>`: Clone an existing Git repository on your computer.

3. `git add <file>`: Adds files to the staging area for tracking. You can use `.` to add all the modified files.

4. `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commits changes to the staging area with a descriptive message.

5. `git status`: Shows the status of files in the working directory and staging area.

6. `git log`: Shows the commit history of the repository.

7. `git branch`: Displays a list of local branches in the repository.

8. `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a specific branch.

9. `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Create a new branch and switch to it.

10. `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge a branch with the current branch.

11. `git pull`: Download changes from a remote repository and merge the changes to the current branch.

12. `git push`: Push local changes to a remote repository.

13. `git remote -v`: Shows a list of configured remote repositories.

14. `git fetch <remote-name>`: Download changes from a remote repository without merging them.

15. `git remote add <remote-name> <URL>`: Adds a new remote repository.

16. `git diff`: Shows the differences between changes in the working directory and the staging area.

17. `git rm <file>`: Removes a file from the repository and working directory.

18. `git stash`: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can switch branches.

19. `git tag <name>`: Create a tag to mark a point in commit history.

These are just some of the most basic Git commands. Git is a very versatile tool with many advanced features, but these commands will give you a solid foundation to start working with version control. You can use "git help" followed by a command to get more detailed information on its usage.
